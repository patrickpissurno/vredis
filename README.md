This module aims to be a full-featured Redis client for [V](https://vlang.io/)

> The version of this module will remain in `0.x.x` unless the language API's are finalized and implemented.

**Project is now compatible with the latest V version thanks to our new contributors**

#### Disclaimer
This project **is alive**, and I'm reviewing and merging pull requests as quickly as possible. Feel free to open PRs with improvements: as long as it keeps the code structure similar and passes the tests, it'll get merged. All features should have their own tests. Thanks!

## Docs

To be done. There will be better docs, but only once I get most of the basic stuff sorted out. For the time being I suggest you to take a look at the test files. They'll provide you with enough to get started.

## Testing
Tests are being implemented alongside every feature. This module is being developed with a 100% coverage goal.

Every commit triggers GitHub Actions to build and test this module.

If you want to run tests manually, be sure to have a Redis server running locally at 127.0.0.1:6379. Then clone this repo and run:

```
v test .
```
